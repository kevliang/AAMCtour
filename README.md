# AAMCtour

## Critical TODO
- [x] Make Alaska / Hawaii under US states
- [ ] redo the form for branching logic
- [ ] airport deletion doesn't work - just deletes FIFO regardless of which city is deleted
- [ ] dropdown for which med school people go to
- [ ] duplicate form submission logic
- [x] page starts halfway down on load

## Backlog
- add vue-cloak
- clean up code / comment code / document
- make the map not fixed width
- css of the form is ugly
- clicking on the destination should just add it right away
- make the entire initial page fit on the screen
- start using bootstrap for everything
- list of airports on the left overlaps with the map when the screen is too narrow
- web performance issues - might crash if there are too many airports
- mobile friendly
- airplane doesn't fully fly between all destinations
    - see bottom of `map.js`
